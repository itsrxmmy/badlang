# **badlang**
Badlang. A new Programming Language built into C++ which tailors to NONE of your needs and wastes much of your time. Semi-esoteric (it can do anything C++ can, it's just C++ with fancy keywords)


# **How to use badlang**

Simple, just download and include the "badlang.hh" header in your C++ files and get to work!


# **Learn badlang**

There is no documentation. Figure it out yourself.


# **The Six Pillars**

In order to achieve badlang nirvana (a challenge yet to be completed), you must build the following projects using ONLY badlang (with the exception of other __required__ languages and tools). NO C, C++, OR GITHUB COPILOT ALLOWED.

1. Hello World Program
2. Operating System 
3. Programming Language / Compiler
4. Game
5. Malware
6. The C Donut
